The purpose of this project is to create a natural language processor for all applications.
Provided the application takes _text_ as input. I want this mainly because I want to learn real tangible things, but the world is flooded with semi repeating information mixed with misquotes.
I hope this system will help me filter.

If what we put in to the internet is categorized at its entry, the what comes out will make sense

###Plan###

* Add a working language processor that changes natural inputs into about topics
     1. Syntaxnet
* Find a way to process the topics so we can have those similar to each other categorized closer and vice versa
* Find a way to transverse through the topics so related inputs can be found and used e.t.c
* now we have related inputs that can be retrieved and used for whatever applications


###Contributors###

* so far just me __Alvin__
